# Rock Paper Scissors Game
Building  a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game with Python (Python Practice Project)

This is a Python practice project for participants in the Chaptr Data Science Cohort. Below are the project details:

# Project Description
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a common game globally. To learn how to play it physically, you can read more from Wiki How. However, all you need to know for this project is that the game is played by two players, all who choose “‘Rock”, “Paper”, or “Scissors” for every round. A win is determined as follows: “Rock” beats “Scissors”, “Scissors” beats “Paper” and “Paper” beats “Rock”.

## Overall Project Description
In this project, you are supposed to write a simple Python script that allows a random user to play against the computer fairly. Since you have not done Graphical User Interface (GUI), a user should only make an input by choosing or writing “rock”, “paper”, or “scissors”, and you should worry about making this graphical in any way.

On top of that, the computer should randomly choose one of the game choices as well for every round (You can visit the Random Module documentation to learn how to do this). Here is how the game should look like:

- A user should be allowed to input rock, paper, or scissors for every round (A basic input function should do)
- The user and the computer should go for three rounds before a winner is determined
- A win is determined as follows: “Rock” beats “Scissors”, “Scissors” beats “Paper” and “Paper” beats “Rock”
- After every round, the user should be prompted who won the round and his/her score versus that of the computer
- At the end of the game, the scores should be printed and a winner stated based on who scored more points
- If a user puts in an invalid input, they should be prompted and that round should be run again
- If a user and the computer choose the same choice, they should be prompted and that round should be run again
- A typical game takes two points to win, therefore, the game should end and a winner stated once one of the players reaches 2 points, whether or not 3 rounds have been played (after all, it would be mathematically impossible for anyone with 0 points to win with one round left)
- Remember to break down your approach to this challenge by introducing comments to make your code more readable/understandable. Also, adhere to the naming conventions and make your variable name descriptive.
- [Optional] Feeling to take the challenge a step further? You can allow the user to choose how many rounds to play per game (enforce the choice to be an odd number) before they start. Note the minimum points required for winning change with the number of rounds and should, therefore, be adjusted.
